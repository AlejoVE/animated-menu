# Animated menu


## Motivation

This project was developed as an CSS exercise, as part of the web development training at [BeCode Liege](https://github.com/becodeorg).

- ## You can check the site [here](https://alejove.github.io/animated-menu/).

## What I did
- A sidebar with 8 divs animated on hover.
- TO hide the text, i use the property ```opacity: 0```.
- To move the text on hover, I used the property: ```transform: translateX(80%);```

## Challenges I faced
- It was a little difficult to find the solution to hide the text and show it correctly on hover.

- I searched a lot about how to  paint the images.

## Status
- Completed
